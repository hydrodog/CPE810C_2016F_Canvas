    List all the function we will need to download files from Canvas and write 2 basic classes 
    function framework.

/*  Date:2016.11.4~Date.11.11 

     We compare 2 ways to send requests to https and decide to use QNetworkAccessManager rather than libcurl. 
     The code now can get access to Canvas by using token in Qt and download some infomation into a file.
     
     
     Mingju He upload the request file which can connect to Canvas and  Jingyi Hu find how to connect Canvas
     byusing cUrl.   Our teamleader Shengjie Hu write the full classes we will need and fix some bugs. 
     
     request  file 
     canvasconnection.cpp
     canvasconnection.h  
     
     TODO:we are going to wrtie codes that can analyze JSON and try to find api that could download all students assignments.
